    I am a dedicated undergraduate student at the Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology, currently majoring in Telecommunications and Networking. As I transition into my sophomore year, I have developed a strong foundation in network systems, computer communications, and emerging digital technologies. My academic journey has not only strengthened my technical skills but has also cultivated problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and a strong sense of teamwork.
<br>
Beyond the classroom, I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge through projects, competitions, and collaborative activities. Serving as an organizer for CFCC 2025 further enhanced my leadership, organizational, and communication skillsâ€”qualities I aim to bring into my future academic and professional endeavors.
<br>
My long-term goal is to contribute to the advancement of telecommunication and networking infrastructure in Cambodia and beyond. I am particularly interested in exploring areas such as network security, cloud systems, and next-generation connectivity solutions. With a commitment to continuous learning and professional growth, I am eager to take on challenges that allow me to merge theory with practice and make a meaningful impact in the digital world.
